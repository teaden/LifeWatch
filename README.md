# LifeWatch

This project incorporates the use of a multivariate linear regression machine learning model. The linear regression was optimized using the gradient descent algorithm. This model uses training and testing data from the World Health Organization's Global Health Observatory to predict average life expectancy across the world. So that user's can use the model to make their own predictions with forecasted data, a web application component utilizing React, Redux, and Express is currently in development.
